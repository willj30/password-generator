# Will's Password Generator

## Description

Here is my very first password generator. I would have finished it on-time but I thought I could make checkboxes work until I realized they wouldn't meet the criteria. In this project I got really intimate with:

- JavaScript
- Prompts
- For loops
- Variables
- Arrays
- and my Computer space

With this password generator you will be able to create passwords between 8 and 128 characters with lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers and special characters.

## Installation

All you need is a device with a browswer, a screen, and internet access.
